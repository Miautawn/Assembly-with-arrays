# What is this?
A simple assembly program that will compare the two arrays and transfer the values from first array if its values match with second array indexes.

## Functionality
The two main arrays, size of [n] and [m], will be filled with random numbers [1:9]. This will be done by using system-time algorythm.
The first array will be filled with any numbers, while the second one will contain only unique values that are [1, n] (the size of the first array).
Then if the values from the first array will match the indexes of the second array, those values will be transfered into the third array

Then, all the arrays are printed out.

## How to run it?
This program was written with NASM, and it can be run locally or [online](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_assembly_online.php)
