# What is this?
A simple assembly program that will compare the two arrays and transfer the values from first array if its indexes match with second array values.

## Functionality
The two main arrays, size of [n] and [m], will be filled with random numbers [1:9]. This will be done by using system-time algorythm.
The first array will be filled with any numbers, while the second one will contain only unique values that are [1, n] (the size of the first array).
Then if the indexes from the first array will match the values of the second array, those values from the first array will be transfered into the third array

Then, all the arrays are printed out.
